Cache reachability results (basic, no invalidation, only caching positive
results)
Examine code for spurious copying/mallocing (done).
Make unit tests! (done) 
Better locking in shard servers needed (done, stress test pending).

Special handling of local traversals - remove msg packing!
Unnecessary copying in message unpacking - first into lvars, then into ret vars.
Make allowance for multiple reach_nodes in reachability requests.
Try to get rid of PO6_NDEBUG_LEAKS.
Check memory leaks using valgrind.
Do code profiling to identify bottleneck functions.
Fault tolerant (chain replicated) coordinator and shards!
