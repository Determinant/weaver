DONE
Fast bulk loading.
    Pending Hyperdex speedup.
Shards
    reverse edges
        traverse edge to node which doesn't exist - require that all in-edges are deleted
    Kronos result caching
Node/edge properties.
Migration experiments.

TODO
Test serializability of transactions.
Permanent deletion.
    Extensive testing needed.
Fault tolerant (chain replicated) coordinator and shards.
Clean up, tackle TODO/XXX.
        migrate_step 2 & 3 - rename, optimize (batch?)
Analytics API - global requests
    Find out why triangle counting is slow.


GREG TODO BEFORE A RELEASE

clean up code in general

get rid of unnecessary copies (possibly getting rid of all copy constructors for things)

clean up node program interface
    special exposed node/edge objects
    no timestamps

allow clients to dynamically load node_program code
    dynamically generate python bindings?

Write-up 'how to make a node program'

Indexing? (later)


BUGS
line_properties.py speeds up with 2 timestampers and 2 shards if nop/vclk update couts are turned on.

WISHLIST
?Failing transactions
Kronos events clean up
