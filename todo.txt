Cache reachability results (basic, no invalidation, only caching positive
results)

Examine code for spurious copying/mallocing.
Make unit tests!

Make allowance for multiple reach_nodes in reachability requests.
Try to get rid of PO6_NDEBUG_LEAKS.
Check memory leaks using valgrind.
Do code profiling to identify bottleneck functions.
