BUGS
(Sync) bug in permanent deletion or node map. Need to reproduce it.

WISHLIST
Make allowance for multiple reach_nodes in reachability requests.
Check memory leaks using valgrind.
Do code profiling to identify bottleneck functions.
Fault tolerant (chain replicated) coordinator and shards!
Expanding the API:
    1. Pagerank
    2. K shortest paths - topic graph
