Clean up, tackle TODO/XXX.
        migrate_step 2 & 3 - rename, optimize (batch?)
Analytics API - global requests
    Find out why triangle counting is slow.


GREG TODO BEFORE A RELEASE

XXX get rid of db::nop_data, only unpack partial nop message to start and just pass message to queue to be fully unpacked later

node.has_property() needed

clean up code in general
allow node programs to not use cache parameters (to clean up interface)

get rid of unnecessary copies (possibly getting rid of all copy constructors for things)
get rid of global_req stuff

make prog_state less global?
make cache invalidation work with permanent edge deletion

If a shard realizes a node program is deleted after it starts running it but before the node program requests a state value, a state value will be created that is never inserted into the state map and dies at the end of the node prog (which will also die because of a check in the prog loop to see if the request completed)

allow clients to dynamically load node_program code
    dynamically generate python bindings?

Write-up 'how to make a node program'

Indexing? (later)


BUGS
line_properties.py speeds up with {1,2} timestampers and 2 shards if nop/vclk update couts are turned on.

WISHLIST
maybe use a try-lock when aquiring many nodes in a row (for node progs, cache context, etc) so forward progress can continue on other nodes in list
